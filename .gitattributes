# Handle line endings per <http://help.github.com/line-endings/>

# Set the default behavior, in case `core.autocrlf` isn't set
# (auto-detect text files and perform LF normalization):
*       text=auto

# Normalize text files & convert to native line endings on checkout:
*.css   text
*.dita* text
*.htm   text diff=html
*.html  text diff=html
*.js    text
*.md    text
*.sass  text
*.scss  text
*.txt   text
*.xml   text
*.xsd   text
*.xsl   text

# These files are binary and should be left untouched:
*.ico   binary
*.jpeg  binary
*.jpg   binary
*.png   binary
# Fonts
*.eot   binary
*.otf   binary
*.ttf   binary
*.woff  binary
