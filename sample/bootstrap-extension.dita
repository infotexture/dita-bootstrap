      <p>
        Bootstrap is designed to be extensible. Additional CSS and JavaScript libraries can be added to the
        generated HTML pages to allow for new Bootstrap components and extend Bootstrap classes. Similarly, the <term
        >DITA Bootstrap</term> plugin itself can be extended to process DITA files to create Bootstrap valid HTML to drive these custom components.
      </p>
